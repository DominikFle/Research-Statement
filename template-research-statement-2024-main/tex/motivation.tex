\section{Motivation}
Machine Vision, ML Data driven, Internship at Sick AG
- Coming from theoretical side of mechanical --> Tensor algebra, Tensor analysis and optimization, generalize well on 
Machine Learning and Deep Learning research. At Prof BÃ¶hlke who comes from mathematical side of mechanical engineering, I learned rigourous 
mathematical thinking and how to apply it to real world problems.


- challenge drives me

- ML has high relevance
\color{red}{ELLIS, Why Ellis:
- ELLIS is a great opportunity to work with the best in the field, to learn from them and to contribute to the field.
- ELLIS is international, oppurtunities
