\section{Closing}
With the support of the ELLIS PhD Program, I am eager to delve into independent research while collaborating with fellow researchers to exchange ideas and insights. I look forward to mentoring students and assisting them with their research projects. The opportunity to engage in intensive research at the lab of my future ELLIS advisor excites me. 

In particular I am interested in working with Prof. Dr. Abhinav Valada and Prof. Dr.-Ing. Andreas Geiger as my research interests strongly align with their work on perception and scene understanding.

The opportunity to collaborate with top-tier laboratories across Europe under the mentorship of renowned researchers in machine learning and its applications such as computer vision is unique withing the ELLIS Program. Its environment is ideal for pursuing novel fundamental and interdisciplinary research. With my solid research background, my software engineering expertise, and closely aligned interests with the programâ€™s faculty, I am confident that I am a suited fit to contribute and excel within the ELLIS PhD program.
