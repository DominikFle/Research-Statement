\subsection{\textbf{ELLIS PhD Program and Advisor}}
The opportunity to conduct intensive research at the lab of my future ELLIS advisor is exciting. In particular I am interested in working with Prof. Dr. Abhinav Valada and Prof. Dr.-Ing. Andreas Geiger, as my research interests are closely aligned with their work on perception and scene understanding.

The opportunity to collaborate with leading laboratories across Europe, under the mentorship of renowned researchers in machine learning and its applications such as computer vision, is unique within the ELLIS Program. The environment is ideal for pursuing novel fundamental and interdisciplinary research. With my solid research background, my software engineering expertise, and well aligned interests with the programâ€™s faculty, I am confident that I am a suited fit to contribute and excel within the ELLIS PhD program.
