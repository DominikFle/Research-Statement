\section{Future research agenda}
- Coming from perception

\subsection{Line of research NeRF}
- Currently following the line of research of nerf \cite{mildenhall2021nerf} pixel nerf, gaussian splatting and mvsplat (technical, perception)
- Both NeRF scene representation and 3D Gaussian representation can represent scenes in a hybrid way. First arbitray 2D views 
of the scene can be rendered which is the main goal of novel view synthesis. Second, the 3D representation can be used for
3D reconstruction and scene understanding. NerF can directly be queried for 3D points and their color. Depending on the target representation the 3D Gaussian representation
can be mapped to voxel or point cloud representations.
\subsection{}
- Self supervised representation learning and pretraining (conceptual)
    --> Masked modeling for point clouds, voxel grids, and images (technical)

- Curriculum learning in combination with regularizing the learning process (conceptual) with multi task learning (technical)
\section{Student mentoring}
